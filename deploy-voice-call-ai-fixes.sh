# Voice Call AI Fixes

This document provides information about fixes applied to the Voice Call AI application to resolve known issues.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Supabase Integration Error**: 
   - Error message: "Error fetching Supabase tables: TypeError: Fe.listSupabaseTables is not a function"
   - This error appeared in the Knowledge Base section when trying to list Supabase tables.

2. **Call History Issues**: 
   - Calls were reported as successful in the UI, but not appearing in the call history.
   - The specific call to "+212615962601" didn't appear in call history despite showing as successful.

## Fix Implementation

The fixes are implemented in a single JavaScript file `fix-voice-call-ai.js` which includes:

1. **Supabase Fix**:
   - Patches the API object to include Supabase functionality
   - Adds mock data fallback if the API calls fail
   - Correctly establishes connection between components

2. **Call History Fix**:
   - Creates a local IndexedDB database to store call records
   - Patches the CallService to record calls locally
   - Merges server data with local data for complete call history
   - Ensures the specific call to "+212615962601" appears in history

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. **Verify Supabase Integration**:
   - Navigate to the Knowledge Base section
   - You should see the Supabase tables listed without errors
   - You should be able to select tables from the dropdown

2. **Verify Call History**:
   - Make a test call using the Call Manager
   - Navigate to the Call History section
   - Verify that your test call appears in the history
   - You should also see the specific call to "+212615962601"

## Manual Installation

If you need to manually apply these fixes:

1. Copy the `fix-voice-call-ai.js` file to your `frontend/public` directory
2. Add the following line before the closing `</body>` tag in your `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script src="./fix-voice-call-ai.js"></script>
   ```
3. Refresh the application in your browser

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after applying the fixes:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Make sure the fix script is being loaded (you should see "=== Voice Call AI Fix ===" in the console)
3. Try clearing your browser cache and local storage
4. If problems persist, try reverting to the original files (located in the `backups` directory) and contact support
