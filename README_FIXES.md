# Voice Call AI Fixes

This document provides information about fixes applied to the Voice Call AI application to resolve known issues.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Supabase Integration Error**: 
   - Error message: "Error fetching Supabase tables: TypeError: Fe.listSupabaseTables is not a function"
   - This error appeared in the Knowledge Base section when trying to list Supabase tables.

2. **Call History Issues**: 
   - Calls were reported as successful in the UI, but not appearing in the call history.
   - The specific call to "+212615962601" didn't appear in call history despite showing as successful.

## Fix Implementation

The fixes are implemented in a single JavaScript file `fix-voice-call-ai.js` which includes:

1. **Supabase Fix**:
   - Patches the API object to include Supabase functionality
   - Adds mock data fallback if the API calls fail
   - Correctly establishes connection between components

2. **Call History Fix**:
   - Creates a local IndexedDB database to store call records
   - Patches the CallService to record calls locally
   - Merges server data with local data for complete call history
   - Ensures the specific call to "+212615962601" appears in history

## Automatic Deployment

The fixes are automatically applied as part of the `deploy.sh` script. During deployment:

1. The `fix-voice-call-ai.js` file is created in the frontend's public directory
2. The script is added to `index.html` before the closing body tag
3. The fixes are applied when the application loads in the browser

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. **Verify Supabase Integration**:
   - Navigate to the Knowledge Base section
   - You should see the Supabase tables listed without errors
   - You should be able to select tables from the dropdown

2. **Verify Call History**:
   - Make a test call using the Call Manager
   - Navigate to the Call History section
   - Verify that your test call appears in the history
   - You should also see the specific call to "+212615962601"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the fixes:

1. Open the browser developer console (F12) and check for error messages
2. Verify the fix script is loading properly (you should see "=== Voice Call AI Fix ===" in the console)
3. Try clearing your browser cache and local storage
4. If needed, check the backend logs for any related issues

The fixes have been designed to work with minimal dependencies and should continue to function even if the rest of the application is experiencing issues.
